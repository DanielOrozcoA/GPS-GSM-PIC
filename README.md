# PIC GPS and GSM Modules
## Description
In this project, through RS232 communication, the PIC18F4550 microcontroller receives geographic information about the location of a GPS module. Such information exchange begins until a key text message is sent from a mobile device, which causes the information received from the GPS to by the microcontroller, it is sent to the mobile device through a GSM module.
